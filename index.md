### Cloudflare
#### Help Center rebranding (Help Center)
More than a writing sample, this entry showcases a site updgrade with a tighter design alignment with the Cloudflare Dashboard. It also shows a marked improvement on information architecture and user experience. 

In the "after" version, the information above the fold was selected based on support ticket volume, frequent customer searches, and insights gained from site analytics. In contrast, the information below the fold aimst to integrate (for the first time) support content with developer portal content.

#### Page Rules tutorial (Help Center)
This sample demonstrates one of the many articles that I revamped and rewrote as part of the drastic improvements that the Cloudflare Help Center experienced while I was at the helm. The rewrite also features a task oriented information architecture and adds a set of related resources.

#### Firewall Rules (Cloudflare Developer Portal)
I architected the original [Cloudflare Firewall Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/firewall/) mini-site featured in the Cloudflare Developer Portal. I also wrote and maintained the initial content in collaboration with the product manager and the technical support team. Because Cloudflare is constantly updating its products, the content has been updated and expanded accordignly, but most of my written work and information design still remains.
